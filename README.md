# Gray Scale Decomposer

The GrayScale decomposer converts images into grayscale and then decomposes
the image into 8 images. Each image respresents when a pixel is a 1 or 0 
at a particular bit value. For example the first image produced (0_bit_image)
contains an image where the pixels are either white or black depending on 
if at bit-0, there is a 1 or 0 value.

Bit-0 typically has the least information and is virtually random, however, 
bit-7 (MSB) tells you a lot of information typically. This is due to the 7 bit being
on if you have a intensity greater than 127. Whereas, the 0-bit or has to be even or odd.

## Code Example 
```python
from grayscale_decomposer import GrayScaleBitDecomposer

gs = GrayScaleBitDecomposer("test.jpg")
gs.produce_image(4, "4-bit-image.jpg") # produce just a 4 bit image example
gs.produce_all_8_images("folder-name") # creates all 8 images at that folder path
```
